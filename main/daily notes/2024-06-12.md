Today:    
    I feel like I should try and start back up with my project but it just feels like such a chore to get started again. The project is a mess and was started when i had vastly less knowledge than i do now. However, with that being said it is still something Iâ€™m proud of and wouldn't feel right abandoning. I just need to keep pushing and work through a lot of the spaghetti code.

To Do:
    - [x] clean room
    - [ ] review stalker code base

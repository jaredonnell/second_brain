#Today:
I feel like I'm dragging along at this point, forcing myself to pick up where
I left. I need to keep pushing and remember why I started.

#Goals:
Regain competence of my Stalker codebase and continue the front end integration
of graph and card rendering. Also, rework the setting of obsidian global
workspaces for better interactivity.

#ToDo:
    - [x] [] Rework obsidian workspace configuration
    - [] Review codebase and chart.js docs
    - [] Remove un-needed backend rendering of card data
    - [] Finish transferring api calls to frontend
    - [] Modularize construction of cards and token limit workaround

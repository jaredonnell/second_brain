Today:
    I'm getting pretty bored with the aesthetic of my current neovim config. If I can actually think of something to build around and not just jump in I may spend today doing just that. Additioanlly, I want to include a feature which can look up a hovered function or method (assuming it is part of a lirary or package) and look up this function within the packages source code using <leader>gd with the go to preview plugin.


ToDo:
    - [ ] Think of design rework
    - [x] Implement source look-up feature
    - [ ] (optional) Continue working on project

Today:
    Figuring out this script has been eating away a lof of my time. On the other hand, I'm still learning new things and training my brain to think like an engineer. I know this process will be long, especially on my own. But I have the determination, I just need to keep going and stay focused.
    Additionally, I've been really excited to jump back into a course. I've been really intrigued to start the Harvard CS50 course and have found some other courses in the back of my head for when I complete the Web Dev course.

ToDo:
    - [x] Dishes
    - [ ] Attempt and test uploading of paper notes to Obsidian
    (No solution really available. Notes will stay physical)
    - [x] Integrate github preservation or notes into sync script
    - [x] Get back to work on the project
